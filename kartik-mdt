  "version": "1.7.7",
  "notes": "Localization support added (locale files coming soon). Optimized MDT size from 18.6MB to 2.6MB for smoother performance. Introduced a new custom editor area for reports (report bugs if any). Fixed: Calls now appear behind MDT; rich text editor dropdown issue; MDT freezing when reopened on reports page; criminal charges wrongly applied to last person instead of first. Minor fixes and general optimizations. Dispatch updates pending â€“ share your ideas on Discord. https://kartik-scripts.gitbook.io"
